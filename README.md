The CIFAR-10 dataset, like many others, may contain inherent biases related to class representation. If particular kinds of objects are underrepresented or overrepresented within classes, the model might develop biases leading to unfair predictions. Deep learning models are often criticized for their "black box" nature, making it difficult to understand and interpret their decision-making processes (Samek et al., 2017). This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in applications where understanding the rationale behind a decision is vital.

As such, the responsibility for the outcomes generated by AI models is with the developers of the technology. Ensuring that there are mechanisms in place to audit and review the model’s decisions is essential for maintaining accountability (Floridi et al., 2018). For this assignment, the CIFAR-10 dataset does not appear to contain PII, however the principles of data privacy should still be considered; if the training data were to include personal images, then that data would need to be obfuscated and/or consent would need to be obtained from data subjects, to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR in the EU(Goodman, 2016). If the trained model is deployed in an application where it interacts with user data, ensuring that this data is handled securely and used responsibly would be crucial to prevent unauthorized access to said data, and ensure compliance with privacy laws (Acquisti et al., 2015).
